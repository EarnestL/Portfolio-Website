              <b>Objective:</b>
              This project is the completed with the intent of introducing
              myself to microcontrollers. I have used <b>PIC16F627A</b> from
              microchip for this purpose as it has all the basic features I
              would need.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                The end result would be a music player that produces at single
                tones with correspondingly flashing LEDs.

            <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
            <p>
              I began by familiarizing myself with <b>PIC16F627A</b> by going through its 
              <a href="https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/40044G.pdf" target="_blank">
                documentation
              </a>
              . I mainly focused on what the
              microcontroller is capable of and eventually settled on PWM to be
              the main tool. The project has not been ideated at this point. I
              decided that it would be easier to determine what tool I'd like to
              use beforehand as the main objective is simply to learn about
              microcontrollers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</b> is a technique that generates
              signal with variable with pulses. In other words, it is
              essentially a digital signal that turns on & off at a specifed
              interval to emulate that of analog. With a use of a transistor,
              this technique can be used to modify a DC voltage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Active Piezoelectric Buzzer</b> produces sound by using
              piezoelectric materials that deforms when alternating voltage is
              applied across them. As the material vibrates rapidly, a sound is
              produced. Active peizo buzzer has a build-in oscilitor, so it is
              able to receive DC voltage.

            <h2>Prototype</h2>

            <p>
              Now that I can recognize what pins of the microcontroller I can
              use, a rough schematic can be sketched out.
            </p>

            <span class="image main"
              ><img src="../images/schm1.jpg" alt=""
            /></span>

            <p>
              <b>Flashing LEDS:</b> Three transistors are used. One will be used
              as a switch to enable/disable the flashing LEDs function as we
              would only like them to be flashing while the music is playing.
              While no sound is being produced, the LEDs will be entirely turned
              off. The other two are used to 'flash' the LEDs alternately
              alongside each shift in the produced tone.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Piezoelectric Buzzer:</b> The buzzer is connected to a
              transistor that is controlled by the generated PWM signal from the
              microcontroller. The pitch of produced music notes corresponds to
              the variable voltage across the buzzer. Therefore, the pitch can
              be shifted accordingly by modifying the duty cycle of the PWM.
              Each song (a sequence of frequencies with varying time interval)
              will have to be incorporated within the microcontroller.
            </p>

            <p>

                >Code for the microcontroller can be found in the
                <a href="#scr">sources</a>.</b

            <h3><u>Demo</u></h3>
            <video width="900" height="500" controls>
              <source src="../videos/demo1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            <p></p>
            <p>
              As you can see, the device is quite janky. The music is quite flat
              and flashing of the LEDs is nowhere near distinct. It may be due
              to a variety of factors such as cheap electronics, loose
              breadboard, and the potential interference caused by bunching of
              the wires. With that, I can turn to PCBs for a greater
              reliability.

              <b>Objective:</b>
              This project is the completed with the intent of introducing
              myself to microcontrollers. I have used <a href="#sources">PIC16F627A</a> from
              microchip for this purpose as it has all the basic features I
              would need.<br>
            
            
              
                The end result would be a music player that produces at single
                tones with correspondingly flashing LEDs.

            <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
            <p>
              I began by familiarizing myself with <a href="#sources">PIC16F627A</a> by going
              through its documentation. I mainly focused on what the microcontroller is capable of and
              eventually settled on PWM to be the main tool. The project has not
              been ideated at this point. I decided that it would be easier to
              determine what tool I'd like to use beforehand as the main 
              objective is simply to learn about microcontrollers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</b> is a technique that generates
              signal with variable with pulses. Essentially, it is a digital
              signal that turns on & off at a specifed interval to emulate that
              of analog. With a use of a transistor, this technique can be used
              to modify a DC voltage.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Active Piezoelectric Buzzer</b> produces sound by using
              piezoelectric materials that deforms when alternating voltage is
              applied across them. As the material vibrates rapidly, a sound is
              produced. Active peizo buzzer has a build-in oscilitor, so it is
              able to receive DC voltage.

            <h2>Prototype</h2>

            <p>
              Now that I can recognize what pins of the microcontroller I can
              use, a rough schematic can be sketched out.
            </p>

            <span class="image main"
              ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarnestL/Music_card/main/Files/Schematic/schm_draft1.jpg" alt=""
            /></span>

            <p>
              <b>Flashing LEDS:</b> Three transistors are used. One will be used
              as a switch to enable/disable the flashing LEDs function as we
              would only like them to be flashing while the music is playing.
              While no sound is being produced, the LEDs will be entirely turned
              off. The other two are used to 'flash' the LEDs alternately
              alongside each shift in the produced tone.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Piezoelectric Buzzer:</b> The buzzer is connected to a
              transistor that is controlled by the generated PWM signal from the
              microcontroller. The pitch of produced music notes corresponds to
              the variable voltage across the buzzer. Therefore, the pitch can
              be shifted accordingly by modifying the period of the PWM signal.
              Each song (a sequence of frequencies with varying time interval)
              will have to be incorporated within the microcontroller.
            </p>

            <h2>Conversion to PCB</h2>

            <p>
              In order to wrap up the project neatly, I have created a pcb with
              the designed circuit. Below is the finalized circuit which was
              sent to a fabricator. Not many major changes were made to the
              rough schematic. (Only the transistors were replaced by a quad
              transistor array.)
